### UICollectionView Course!
This is source code for 1/3 of my UICollectionView [Course Located Here!](http://bit.ly/githubdragdropcoupon) I show students step by step how to build this project.
I also show students how to drag, drop, reaarange, and move UICollectionViewCells within UICollectionViews and to external Collection Views by uitilizing protocols such as UICollectionViewDragDelegate and DropDelegate.
